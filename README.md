# [Cure Tools](https://cure-tools.web.app/)

## This is a full stack project built by only me.

- This is a website for a manufacturing company that provides medical tools for dentists.
- This website has different features for admins and general users.
- A general user can see the profile, a page to add a review, and all his orders. On the 'orders' page, he will see a payment method to pay for his ordered products.
- An admin can see five pages including the profile page. They are:

1. manage users wherein he can make a user an admin or remove him,
2. Manage orders page,
3. Manage products page
4. Add a new product page
   (Use these email and password to see admin routes; email: human@being.com password: human@being.com)

- I used tailwind CSS and daisy UI to style the site.
- Firebase authentication and JSON web token are used to secure the site.
- Stripe is used to create a payment method

- Heroku server is used for hosting data and MongoDB is used to store the data
